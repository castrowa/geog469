	<h1>Conclusion and Recommendations</h1>
	<p><b>Conclusion: </b>The objective for the project was to investigate if there were any unusual patterns in the number of fatalities by police over the last five years and if possible, further back. With this in mind, we were able to determine five important need-to-know questions to guide our research. We sought to identify the relationships of police involved fatalities between time and space prior to correlating our findings to state de-escalation policies. The UW FFRG created an online application that provided most of the graphs and maps. Using the dataset and interactive maps they provided we were able to further investigate and analyze them as appropriate and follow up with policies enacted for those findings.</p>
	<p>Tying it back home, to Washington, we have also started to look more into passing policies related to police fatal force. Initiative 940, De-Escalate Washington was passed in March 2018 in conjunction with House Bill 3003. This initiative requires our police force to undergo training on approaching mental illness, de-escalation in regards to violence, and first-aid. Although Washington, with Seattle as one of its densest cities, can be regarded as a very liberal state, we did not come up in the results of the declining states. With the values that we hold ourselves to of inclusion, we hope that this initiative will put our state off of the statistics that adds onto police involved fatalities.</p>

	<p><b>Recommendations: </b>Right now, the analyses done in relation to tying the de-escalation policies back to our research has all been manual. We started out with the fatalencounters dataset, determined all the states that had a decrease in police involved fatalities and then did a change point analysis on those states. This led us to comparing and contrasting the de-escalation policies that those states had enacted that could lead to the decrease in fatalities. For the future, we would like to do some research on potential sites that has an inventory of all policies passed and pending for all the states. Finding such a site can reduce labor costs and increase efficiencies. We can use this site to create an automatic lookups of policies for any state that stakeholders would like to see. Creating this can lead to many other possibilities as well. This includes creating options for uses to be able to compare and contrast various statesâ€™ policies, like we did for California and Nebraska, themselves.</p>
