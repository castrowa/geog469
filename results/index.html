title: US Distribution of Police Involved Fatalities
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Discussion of Results</h1>
	<p>For our project, we had five main need to know questions: “What are the demographics of the victims?”, “When did these cases happen?”, “Where are the cases of fatal force happening?”, “What are the methods of force between male, female, and transgender used in the events that resulted in fatality?”, and “Which states do we see a decrease in declining fatality?”. Dynamic and static maps were produced to answer these questions, generated by both the UW Fatal Force Research Group and some by our team.</p>

	<h2>What are the demographics of the victims?</h2>
	<p>The graph for this need to know question, generated by the UW FFRG, was split into the demographics of race, age, and gender. While doing a comparison across time, a comparison is first done through the subjects’ race and age. The race shown is split into blacks, latinos, and whites. From the visualization, we can see that whites, compared to latinos and blacks, has fatalities more evenly spread across age, and the distribution increases with time. Blacks and latinos on the other hand, has the most fatalities during the ages of 20-30, peaking at the mid-20’s. Further analysis has to be done at a per fatality level in order to accurately determine the reason why, but the general can infer that there must be some biases involved as the distribution of white victims increasingly spreads out by age, yet blacks and latinos, people of color, seems to keep peaking at the fatal ages of their 20’s.</p>
	<p>The second graph generated by the UW FFRG is a comparison across time, split between subjects’ gender and age. Through the graph, a difference in distribution can be seen between the years of 2013 compared to 2014-2015 and 2016-2017. In recent years, the correlation between female and males seems to be catching up to each other as the blue and pink colors more closely overlap each other. In comparison, the years 2014 and 2015 has more distribution between females across time compared to their counterparts. Fatality for females had a drastic decrease in distribution from 2014 to 2017. In 2014, female fatality developed a peak into their 50’s, but that peak is barely visible in 2017. Deeper analysis should be done to more accurately determine the reason for this shift in distribution. Overall, the peak age of fatality for males seems to be increasing, from mid-20’s in 2013 to late-20’s in 2017.</p>

	<h2>When did these cases happen?</h2>
	<p>From the ShinyApp created by the UW FFRG, we can use the interactive choropleth map to answer our question of when. The choropleth depicts the fatal encounters by state at a level of civilian deaths by police per million capita across time. Using this map, a selection of year can be done to show the density of fatalities for the US. Using this, for the year 2016, we can see that there is high intensity for the states of New Mexico and Alaska. With this knowledge, a deeper analysis can be done to determine current events for those states in 2016 and tying them into policies passed or not passed that resulted in the concentration of fatalities.</p>
